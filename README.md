This is a fork of https://github.com/WebKit/WebKit/tree/main/PerformanceTests/Speedometer that runs 
performance tests with enforced Trusted Types (https://w3c.github.io/webappsec-trusted-types/dist/spec/). 

The main purpose of this project is to measure performance impact of enfocing Trusted Types in couple of 
standard sample apps. Data from such test runs will then be analysed to test hypothesis that enforcement of 
Trusted Types has negligible impact on app performance.
